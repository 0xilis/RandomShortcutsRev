# RandomShortcutsRev
Random rev of shortcuts (mostly iOS 15.2/15.4 WorkflowKit). By absolutely no means even close to complete, I really just do stuff randomly.

I started this to potentially look into some vulns with Shortcut Signing. iOS 15.0b1 had a rather embarassing bug that was found and published a couple hours after release where you could simply name a unsigned shortcut to .wflow (old file extension) and it would import properly. This made me curious as to how Shortcuts are imported, and if there was any bug that could be triggered not with checking the shortcuts signature, but with the importing itself (such as with 15b1) in Shortcuts. I was not able to find anything - I came *close* and found something that may lead to one (that is, assuming you can even craft an unsigned shortcut that could be importable beginning with AEA1) but have not got anything from it yet. This is why a lot of the classes on here are related to shortcuts signing. I have, however, looked into some various other stuff in WorkflowKit, such as WFBundledActionProvider, the class for loading actions from WFActions.plist.

This reverse engineering project of WorkflowKit.framework is highly incomplete and innaccurate, and I would advise attempting to rely upon it. However - it does still feature some useful info for some methods who's behavior (tmk) have never been documented - hence IMO this may be still useful for some people.
